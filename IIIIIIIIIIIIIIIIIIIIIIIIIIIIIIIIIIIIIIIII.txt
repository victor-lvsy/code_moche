École Nationale Supérieure de l'Électronique et de ses Applications (also known as ENSEA) is a graduate school (grande école) of electrical engineering and computer science, located in Cergy (in Val d'Oise department) close to Paris in France.

It was founded in 1952 under the name of ENREA and became ENSEA in 1976.
Admissions

Future engineers are recruited after a centralized and selective country-wide specific entrance examination ("Classes Préparatoires") or laterally into final or pre-final year after a bachelor's degree in electronics or relevant scientific fields (physics, chemistry, electronics, computer science, etc.).
Programs
Grande École Degree

The Engineering degree (or Diplôme d'Ingénieur de l'École Nationale Supérieure de l'Electronique et de ses Applications) delivered by L'Académie de Versailles; is equivalent to the master's degree in engineering in the United States. Courses spread over three years cover all aspects of electrical, electronics and computer science and engineering, e.g.: signal processing, microelectronics, embedded systems, software engineering, networking, control and power electronics besides some important non-engineering courses such as economics, management, business communications and foreign languages.
M.S. Specialized Masters Programs

ENSEA and ITIN offer also an MS Specialized Master labelled by the Conférence des grandes écoles[1] and named TIM (Mobile IT and Telecommunication)[2]
